a month of daily temperatures corresponding to the expected spring climatological daily
maximum in Chennai, India, would be termed a heat wave in France; a
snow storm expected every year in New York, USA, might initiate a
disaster when it occurs in southern China.

When the overall distribution
of the climate variable changes, what happens to mean climate may
be different from what happens to the extremes at either end of the
distribution
For example, a warmer mean climate could result from fewer cold days,
leading to a reduction in the variance of temperatures, or more hot days,
leading to an expansion in the variance of the temperature distribution,
or both.
